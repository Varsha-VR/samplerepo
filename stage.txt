git add adds the file from directory to staging area and git commit adds the file from staging area to repository.
There might be 30-40 files in your project, which is to be committed But you want that there should be 10-15 files in this commit, so you'll put those files in the staging area and from there your files will be committed. 
git log command is used to see the no of previous commits, who did, where and we get all the information here.
git add . by this command all the files will come in the staging area.
